**1. In "census_income.csv" dataset, find out if variable hours.per.week follows normal distribution using density plots.**

**2. Use stacked barcharts to find out if outcome Y is affected by (behaves differently across) variables race or relationship. Note: You'll have to explore option position in geom_bar.**

**3. Show visually that hours.per.week vary similarly across age for both the sexes.**

**4. Using point plots with jitter instead of boxplots, create plots for capital.gain and capital.loss with outcome Y to examine their behaviour across both outcomes.**

**5. Examine behaviour of fnlwgt for classes of Y and within that for both the sexes.**

**6. Examine hours.per.week by workclass, which one will be a better choice, a box plot, a violin plot or simple point plot with jitter, think and discuss pros and cons associated with each.**
