# 1.1 Introduction

In general data is gathered for the purpose of answering a question, or more specifically, a research question but, *the data we deal within the industry is too big* to go through each and every observation.

</center>

___

In order to understand the data, we need to come up with a way to **summarise** this so that you can quickly go through the summary and understand your data faster.

</center>

___

Lets look at kind of **summaries** we need to consider to understand our data in a comprehensive manner. There are **three facets** of the data that we need to summarize in order to capture all aspects of the data:

1. **Central Tendency**
2. **Variability**
3. **Shape**

</center>

___

In **univariate statisitcs**, we explore each variable in a dataset separately. We look at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. It describes the individual variables.

# 1.2 Measures of Central Tendency

**Central tendency** is the average behaviour of the data. Central tendency is the value of your data which is most expected outcome. There are **three measures** for central tendency:

1. **Mean**
2. **Median**
3. **Mode**

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/Measures-Of-Central-Tendency.jpg"`){width=50%}

</center>

## 1.2.1 Mean

Mean is simply defined as the average of the values.

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/mean.jpg"`)

</center>

Consider the average of these numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7). It is 4. 

Now, if include another value to this set of values say 10000, then the average becomes 1257, which is no where close to majority of the data (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10000). 

This tells us that mean is not a good measure of central tendency if data contains extreme values or outliers.

## 1.2.2 Median

**Median** is defined as the middle most value when your data is sorted. 

**For example**, if your data is (1,10,8,7,9,12,3), you'd sort it (1,3,7,8,9,10,12), your data has 7 elements, the middle most term will be (7+1)/2 th term which is 8.

If your data has even number of elements then you'll have two middle most values. 

**For example**, lets consider this data (1,3,7,8,9,10,12,14000). Two middle most terms are 8 & 9, median is taken as average of these two middle most values which is 8.5

You might have noticed by now that median doesnt not depend on the values of elements, only on their
order in the data which makes it not so sensitive to extreme values present in the data.

</center>

## 1.2.3 Mode

**Mode** is simply defined as the value which occurs most frequently in the data. It is mostly used for categorical variables because numerical summaries do not make sense in context of categorical variables.

A dataset can have multiple modes, since highest frequency can be equal for many categories of the categorical variable. As opposed to this mean and median for a dataset take a single value.

___

## 1.2.4 Use Case: **mtcars** dataset

We will start with calculating **mean** and **median** values of variable **mpg** in the data. Lets load the data first using the **data** function. 

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

___

You can view the complete dataset using the **View** function.

```{r}
View(mtcars)
```

___

To look at the head of the data, we will use **head** function.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

___

Lets calculate the mean of the mpg variable using the **mean** function from base R.

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

___

Similarly, to calculate the median we will use **median** function.

```{r}
median(mtcars$mpg)
```

# 1.3 Measures of Dispersion

Lets start with discussing **variability**, datasets having same average do not neccessarily behave in a same fashion. They might differ in terms of spread. Here is an example, both the datasets have their average as 10.

(7,8,9,10,11,12,13) : 10

(-100,-50,10,90,100) : 10

You can see that the second dataset is much more spread out in comparison to the first one, inspite of them having same mean. There are many ways in which this spread can be measured:

* **Range**
* **Standard Deviation / Variance**
* **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**
* **Inter Quartile Range**

## 1.3.1 Range

**Range** is simply defined as difference between minimum and maximum values in the data. 

Its a very primitive measure and is rarely used. 

You can observe that since it relies on extreme values in your data to start with, it is very sensitive to presence of extreme values in your data.

## 1.3.2 Standard Deviation / Variance

The **standard deviation** is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values about the mean value. 

It is useful in comparing sets of data which may have the same mean but a different range.

<center>

</center>

___

**Variance** is simply square of the standard deviation.

## 1.3.3 Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

Spread is defined as deviation of individual values from the mean of the data. If you simply try to add these deviations and take average, positive and negative deviations will cancel each other out. Average absolute values of these deviation is one way to avoid effect of signs in the deviations.

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/MAD.gif"`)

</center>

## 1.3.4 Inter Quartile Range (IQR)

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/quartiles.png"`)

</center>

**IQR** is defined as difference between q1 and q3 where q1, q3 are first and third quartiles respectively. 

Quartiles are the values which divide your data into 4 parts. 

Median is second quartile or q2, it divides into two equal parts. 

You can consider q1 to be median of the first part and q3 to be median of the second part.

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/IQR.jpg"`)

</center>

All of the measures that we discussed for spread are **sensitive** to extreme values. **IQR** is one measure which is not sensitive to outliers.

___

Lets calculate **minimum**, **maximum**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** values of variable mpg in the data.

```{r}
min(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
max(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
var(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
sd(mtcars$mpg)
```

___

You can use summary function to generate a standard 6 point summary from a variable or entire data.

```{r}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```

___

Lets see the summary of entire mtcars dataset

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

# 1.4 Shapes of Distributions

Measures of central tendency and variability still do not tell how frequently a value occurs in your data or in other words, given a value what are the chances that it will be in the data.

To get an idea regarding the same we can plot frequency bar charts or histograms. The shape depicted by
these histograms can be of **three types**:

1. **Symmetric**
2. **Positively Skewed**
3. **Negatively Skewed**

**Shape** is also represented in terms of distributions which we discuss in detail in hypothesis testing module. 

For now you can understand symmetric shape to be where data values on either side of the mean are equally probable where as for positively and negatively skewed data has unbalanced properties.

For a symmetric shape:

**Q2 - Q1 = Q3 - Q2**

For positively skewed shape:

**Q2 - Q1 < Q3 - Q2**

For negatively skewed shape:

**Q2 - Q1 > Q3 - Q2**

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/shapes.png"`)

</center>

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

___

Lets start with looking at **class** of these outputs. If the class is something that we are not familiar with, we'll next look for names of elements within the output in their class.

```{r}
summ = summary(mtcars$mpg)
summ
```

```{r}
class(summ)
```

```{r}
names(summ)
```

___

Now we know names of each components, we can use them to fetch the values:

```{r}
summ["Min."]
```

___

Now lets try the same with summary of entire data.

```{r}
sumry = summary(mtcars)
sumry
```

```{r}
class(sumry)
```

```{r}
names(sumry)
```

___

This gets a little confusing. If outputs doesnt have any names, how can we access any of the output? 

Lets try with numeric indices.

```{r}
sumry[1,2]
```

___

There are other summary functions as well coming from different packages in R. We'll look at one, that
doesnt mean there are not others.

```{r}
library(psych)
```

```{r}
describe(mtcars)
```

You can see that this gives much more detailed **summary** of the dataset. Lets try to acces these values as well.

___

```{r}
s = describe(mtcars)
s
```

```{r}
class(s)
```

you can see that the underlying class of the output object is **data.frame**. Good news, we know how to access ths output. 

___

Here rownames are variables names of the dataset mtcars, column names are summary stats name. So if I wanted to look at **max** value of variable gear.

```{r}
s["gear","max"]
```

___

or multiple summaries of multiple variables basically you can get any kind of subset from this data.frame

```{r}
s[c("gear","mpg","wt"),c("max","sd","skew")]
```

___

To get an idea about shape of a variable , we can plot **boxplot** and **histograms**.

```{r}
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
hist(mtcars$hp,breaks=10)
```

___

# 1.5 Use Case: **Arthritis** Dataset

So far we have been looking at summaries of numeric variables only. How do we start to summarize categorical variables? 

Maximum that we can do is to look at what distinct values a **categorical variable** takes and what are the frequencies of these values in the data. 

**Cross tables** between two or more categorical variable is also a great source of insights. To learn how to do that in R, we'll be using datasets **Arthritis** from package **vcd**.

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/arthritis.jpg"`){width=30%}

</center>

```{r}
library(vcd)
```

```{r}
data(Arthritis)
```

```{r}
View(Arthritis)
```

You can get details of the data set by running **?Arthritis**. 

___

To get simple frequency table of single variable you can use function **table**.

```{r}
freq = table(Arthritis$Improved)
freq
```

___

You can convert these counts to percentage by apply function **prop.table** on the output of function table.

```{r}
prop.table(freq)
```

___

You can apply round off to this output or convert it to proper percentages by multiplying by 100

```{r}
round(prop.table(freq),2)
```

```{r}
prop.table(freq)*100
```

___

For creating cross tables between two or more variables , you can either use function **table** or **xtabs**.

```{r}
table(Arthritis$Improved,Arthritis$Sex)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~Improved + Sex, data = Arthritis)
```

```{r}
cross_tab = xtabs(~Treatment + Improved, data = Arthritis)
cross_tab
```

___

Applying **prop.table** on this count table will give you overall percentages, but you might interested in percetnage across a particular dimension. 

You can achieve that by supplying dimension number as second argument.

```{r}
prop.table(cross_tab)
```

```{r}
prop.table(cross_tab,1)
```

```{r}
prop.table(cross_tab,2)
```

___

**margin.tables** does not look like a very useful function at this point of time when we are looking at two way tables only, it will have more utility if used with higher dimension cross tables. 

```{r}
margin.table(cross_tab)
```

```{r}
margin.table(cross_tab,1)
```

```{r}
margin.table(cross_tab,2)
```

___

For now, the next thing that we are going to discuss is, adding sum across a dimension without collapsing the table. This can be done using **addmargins** function.

```{r}
addmargins(cross_tab)
```

```{r}
addmargins(cross_tab, 1)
```

```{r}
addmargins(cross_tab, 2)
```

___

Now, we'll look at a **three-way cross table**. To make the display more intuitive we'll use function **ftable**. 

Keep in mind that this function doesn't change counts in any manner, it just changes the way count table is being displayed.

```{r}
cro_tab= xtabs(~Treatment+Sex+Improved,data=Arthritis)
cro_tab
```

```{r}
ftable(cro_tab)
```

___

Applying **margin.table** on this with individul dimension index or a vector index produces appropriate
collpased tables.

```{r}
margin.table(cro_tab,1)
```

```{r}
margin.table(cro_tab,c(1,3))
```

___

Here is an example of applying prop.table with dimension vector.

```{r}
ftable(prop.table(cro_tab,c(1,3)))
```

___

To understand the output better here, we are going to add margins to the output as well

```{r}
ftable(addmargins(prop.table(cro_tab,c(1,2)),3))
```
